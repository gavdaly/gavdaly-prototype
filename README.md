# About

This is a prototype for my website written in React using the WordPress Rest API.

# TODO:

- Add Infinite scrolling on the journal
- Make a component to hold twitter and GitHub
- write my own service worker to prefetch the data
- Have the nav bar fixed to the bottom of the page
- Style images better
